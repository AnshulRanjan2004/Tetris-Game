# Tetris-Game
2nd semester college project made only using C language.
Used ncurses only to read, and time the loop. Tried to use as few libraries as possible.

You can make new shapes and change the table dimensions easily!:)

# How to run

2. then run make. On Mac and Linux run make in your team.
